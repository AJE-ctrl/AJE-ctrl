👋 Hi, I’m @AJE-ctrl Alana
👀 I’m interested in building apps that support my team in the animal rescue and animal-assisted therapy sector.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about app development and basic coding to try and use tools to increase the efficiency and efficacy of our services.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools for shelter time management, animal marketing, and well-being tracking.
📫 How to reach me: alana.ellis@HPHHfoundation.org
😄 Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: Rescue animals have been shown to increase human empathy and lower stress levels—both for the people working with them and the animals themselves! 
Every interaction can make a positive difference for everyone involved.
